## Introduction

Welcome to my collection of Java programming problem solutions. This repository serves as a personal archive of my journey through various coding challenges and algorithm problems. Each solution is implemented in Java and includes detailed comments explaining the approach, time and space complexity, and any key concepts used.

The problems solved here range from basic algorithmic challenges to more complex data structure implementations and advanced algorithmic puzzles. This collection not only showcases my problem-solving skills but also serves as a resource for others learning Java programming or preparing for coding interviews.

Topics covered in this repository include, but are not limited to:
- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees and Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Object-Oriented Design
- Concurrency and Multithreading
- Java Collections Framework

## How to Use

1. Browse through the repository to find a problem you're interested in.
2. Each solution file contains:
   - The problem statement in comments at the top
   - The solution code
   - Explanatory comments throughout the code
   - Time and space complexity analysis
3. Feel free to use these solutions as a reference or for learning purposes.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run a Java program:

    bash
    javac FileName.java
    java FileName
Replace FileName with the name of the Java file you want to run.
Some problems may require additional Java libraries or specific JDK versions. In such cases, specific compilation and execution instructions will be provided in the file's comments.
